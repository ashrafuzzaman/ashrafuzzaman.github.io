This is a reference post for documenting all the concepts for Kubernetes.

# Cluster Architecture

Kubernetes cluster is made of at least one **master node** and **worker nodes**.

## ðŸ“˜ Definitions

**Node :** Virtual or physical machines.\
**Master node:** A master node is a node which controls and manages a set of worker nodes\
**Worker node:** Mostly referred as Node where the containers are launched\
**Kubelet:** Kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each worker node, so that they can communicate with each other. They also execute some tasks on the node
