# Distributed system

## The basics <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Topic

- Total order
- Failure detection

<!-- .element: class="fragmented-list" -->

---

<!-- .slide: data-transition="fade-in" -->

### Order between events

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor Observer

  Note over Server 1 : Event 1.1
  Note over Server 2 : Event 2.1
```

---

<!-- .slide: data-transition="fade-in" -->

### Order between events

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor Observer

  Note over Server 1 : Event 1.1
  Note over Server 2 : Event 2.1

  Note left of Observer : Event 1.1
  Note left of Observer : Event 2.1
```

---

### NTP Sync

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Server-->>NTP: Get time
  NTP-->> Server: Time

  Note over Server, NTP : Server time =<br/>NTP time + round trip time/2

```

---

### Challenge of timestamps üïí

- Syncing time on network is unreliable
- Keeping the clock synced is expensive

---

### Logical time

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor Observer
  participant Server 1
  participant Server 2

  Note over Server 2 : Event 2.1
  Note over Server 1 : Event 1.1
  Server 1-->>Server 2 : T=1
  Note over Server 2 : Event 2.2

  Note left of Observer : Event 2.1, Event 1.1
  Note left of Observer : Event 2.2

```

---

### Key takeaways

- Network is unreliable
- NTP sync cannot be trusted

## Failure detection

---

## Detecting node failure

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Replica 1
  participant Replica 2
  participant Master

  Replica 1 -->> Master: Ping
  Master -->> Replica 1: Pong

  Replica 2 -->> Master: Ping

  opt Network timeout
    Master -->> Replica 2: ‚ùå
  end

```

---

## Node failure types

- Crash Stop
- Omissions
- Crash Recovery
- Byzantine / Arbitrary

<!-- .element: class="fragmented-list" -->

---

### Crash Stop

- Node stop doing anything(sending/receiving/processing)
- Once fail never recover

<!-- .element: class="fragmented-list" -->

---

### Crash Stop: Challenges

- Can lead to leader election
- Initiate rebalancing/replication
- Identification of latest checkpoint

<!-- .element: class="fragmented-list" -->

---

### Omissions

- **Sending omission:** not sending data where node is supposed to send according to algorithm
- **Receiving omission:** not receiving data when other node has sent message

---

Omission is actually a **temporary** state which eventually turns to a **crash** or a **crash recovery** state.

---

### Crash Recovery

- A node might crash
- It recovers after crashing and initiates a recovery process

<!-- .element: class="fragmented-list" -->

---

### Crash Recovery: Challenges

- Recovery process
- Compensation

<!-- .element: class="fragmented-list" -->

---

### Byzantine / Arbitrary

A node may behave arbitrary(sending/receiving messages that are not specified by algorithm).

This can be a malicious attack to the system.

---

### Network partition

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor Client 1
  participant Replica 1
  participant Replica 2
  participant Master
  actor Client 2

  Replica 1-->>Master: Ping
  Master-->>Replica 1: Pong

  Client 1->>Master: Write

  Replica 2-->>Master: Ping

  opt Network parition: Master | Others
    Master-->>Replica 2: ‚ùå
    Client 2->>Master: Read
  end

```
