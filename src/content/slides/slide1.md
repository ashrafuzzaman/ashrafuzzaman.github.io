# Linked List Problem (10 minutes)

In this first problem, we ask you to add to an existing Linked List class by creating a method that will a delete node that contains a specific value that is passed into the method. If the value we are searching for is not present in the linked list, do not modify the linked list.

```java
public void deleteNode(int data) {
  // write your code here
}
```
